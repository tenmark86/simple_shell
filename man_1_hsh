.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSimple_Shell\fR is a homebrewed \fBsh\fR-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. Everytime a command is executed in the interactive method described above it will print the shell prompt again after execution is finished. Its use is very similar to the \fIsh\fR command line interpreter with the exceptions listed below.
.SH OPTIONS
This shell does not take any options as of now. However it does handle the CTRL+D and CTRL+C keyboard signals.
.SH ARGUMENTS
This shell does not take arguments but if what is desired is to interpret a command in a non interactive fashion then it must be invoked as descibed in the \fIInvocation\fR section.
.SH INVOCATION
\fBInteractive Mode - \fRTo call the shell in its interactive mode it must be called as follows:

\fB./hsh

After this invocation the prompt will be printed and the user will be able to enter command line arguments.

\fBNon-Interactive Mode -\fR To call the shell in its non-interactive mode you first call the command and then pipe it to the shell as follows:

[Command] [Command Options] [Arguments] ... | ./hsh

After this invocation the shell will exit and return to the terminal that called it.
.SH BUILT-INS
The shell has a few built-in functions. These are: \fBexit, env \fRand \fBcd.\fR
.SH BUGS
The shell does not handle the following special characters\fI\fR ", ', `, \\, *, &, #, &&, ||.
